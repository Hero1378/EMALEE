Can't use '|' in doc, as interpreted as newlines > Can fix by writing method 'getExistingBars', then when parsing,
exclude the coords of the existing bars returned by the method above.

                       barLocations.append(currCharNumber - 1) # '-1' to counteract machine starting from 0

                    TAKE NOTE OF TO AVOID POTENTIAL SMELL

Can't find string ending or starting with punctuation '()[]{},.?|\!"Â£$%^&*' > do 'remove and get punctuation methods.

IN findPunctuation:
                    currPuncPos[1] = currCharNumber - 1 # Counteract startpoint being 0

                    POTENTIAL BUG!
>>> when removing items from the list, all startpoints become invalid, due to the length of the list decreasing i.e.:


Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, agam eius duo ut, enim justo ex duo. Nam cu sumo vide labore. Laudem civibus vim in.
                         -^=

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet agam eius duo ut, enim justo ex duo. Nam cu sumo vide labore. Laudem civibus vim in.

Fix by subbing 1 from each 'coord'
