A Python- based text file editor, that changes certain words based upon Gender,
Status to the user and "age".

== Usage ==

This program is primarily designed to be used as a test for a future Java- Based
project. The user should be able to [paste text into a medium], or select a file
from a GUI for the program to translate.
The user would then {enter the person ion question's status}, or select who the 
message is aimed at.
Finally, the program would {produce a re- formatted copy of the pasted text}, or
point- to/ open a direct Rory based upon the user's system, containing the
re- formatted version of the file. "|Alternatively, if the file was to be used as
text in an E- mail client, the program would paste the text into the client, and
open up the GUI in question|"
